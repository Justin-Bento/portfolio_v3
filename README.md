# V3 Portfolio Website

This was the third version of my portfolio website, created to showcase my work as a web designer and developer. 

It included projects, case studies, and technical experiments completed between 2024 and 2025. 

At the time, I didn’t have space for side projects, and the tech stack I chose was too convoluted.

The focus for this website was to use a content management system alongside Next.js. 

However, the complexity of the stack caused performance issues during deployment and made the site difficult to maintain long-term. On top of that, I wasn’t happy with the design — it was too plain and didn’t truly represent me as a person.

Eventually, I switched to using the Dante theme from Just Good UI and tailored it to better reflect my style and approach, resulting in a cleaner, more maintainable, and more personal portfolio.
